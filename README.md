helpful-tip
===========

Dynamically set-up tooltip definitions for your pre-defined keywords. Very helpful for uncommon jargon and terms that new visitors might not know about.

### Prerequisites

* jQuery

### Usage

```javascript
jtip(
	object
);
```

You can pass in an object inline or by its variable name.

Example output:

```html
<a href="#" class="tip" title="A written or printed work consisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers.">book</a>
```

### Styling

You can add underlining or other styles to defined keywords by using the .tip selector. All defined words are given this class.
