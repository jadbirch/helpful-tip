===========

Dynamically set-up tooltip definitions for your pre-defined keywords. Very helpful for uncommon jargon and terms that new visitors might not know about.

### Prerequisites

* jQuery

### Usage

```javascript
jtip(
	object
);
```

You can pass in an object inline or by its variable name.

Example output:

```html
<span title="Any of various birds of the order Galliformes, especially the common, widely domesticated chicken " class="tip">fowl</span>
```
